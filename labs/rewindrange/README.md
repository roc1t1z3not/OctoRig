Be kind, rewind — then exploit. Rewind Range is a deliberately vulnerable retro VHS and video-game store brimming with 80s and 90s nostalgia, SQL injection across every filter, broken object-level access on private messages, and reflected script execution hiding in plain sight.

## What to Try

- The `/browse` endpoint accepts `genre`, `platform`, `type`, and `year` query parameters. All of them feed straight into a raw SQL query. How far can you take a UNION?
- The `/search` endpoint reflects `?q=` back into the page. Does it escape your input before rendering?
- Private messages are at `/inbox/<id>`. Does the server verify you're the intended recipient, or is sequential enumeration enough?
- The feedback board stores user submissions. Is the content sanitised before it's displayed to the next visitor?
- `/vhs-vault`, `/late-fees`, and `/manager-office` are disallowed in `robots.txt`. Worth a look.
